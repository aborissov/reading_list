Hard X-ray emission from the solar corona
Krucker et al 2008

Early emission
	A few observations (see references in section 2.1) show HXR emission before the impulsive phase.
	Energies obtained >10 keV
	Weak footpoint emission, most comes from corona

Masuda flare
	First observation of coronal HXR emission
	7Mm above thermal loop, 30 - 50 keV energy, similar time evolution to footpoint sources
	No enhanced soft xray emission
	Disappears after impulsive phase

	Most flares don't seem to follow this pattern, with separations between HXR and thermal emission being less or non-existent

Double coronal source
	See references, but seems to be an interesting exception(?)

Coronal thick target
	HXR emission from corona, little from footpoints
	See papers by Veronig and Brown 2004, etc
	High column densities in SXR loops, electrons do not reach chromosphere
	High density attributed to chromospheric evaporation

HXR motion
	See Sui et al 2006
	The position of HXR sources seems to move around sometimes, starting a bove the limb, moving down along the flare loop, reach near the footpoints, then move up again
	Downward speed ~500-700 km/s, upawrd 340 km/s
	Inconsistent with sound speed or alfven speed

HXR from high corona
	Kane et al 1992 observe emission up to 80 keV for flare occulted by 40 degrees
	Others have seen similar, so not uncommon
	Associated with CMEs
	Emission shows fast rise, slower exponential decay, indicative of collisional losses without further acceleration.
	Up to 10% of electrons >10 keV in flare may be in high corona

Gamma ray emission also present
